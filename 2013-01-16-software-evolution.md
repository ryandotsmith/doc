# Software Evolution: A Closer look at queue_classic.

This article is a work in progress.

Introduction:

Writing the code is the first of many steps in software development. Over the years I have grown to appreciate the value of mature software. I have also come to appreciate proper evolution of software. I believe there is a fine art to building, scaling, sharing, sunsetting software that is begging to be shared.

Outline:

* Understanding the problem you are solving is step 0.
* Explore the stages of evolution.
* Unchanging projects are usually irrelevant.
* Wide surface area can inhibit changes thus leading to irrelevance.
* Let experiments be experiments.
* It is not a "thing" until you have people who would be upset should the thing go away.
